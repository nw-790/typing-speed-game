# ⌨️ Typing Speed Game

A simple but dynamic **Typing Speed Game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Type the displayed sentence as fast and accurately as you can — the app measures your **WPM (words per minute)** and gives you real-time feedback for each character you type, just like **Monkeytype**.
